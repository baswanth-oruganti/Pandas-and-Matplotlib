# Information on Scripts


This repo contains scripts for data analysis and visualization for data obtained from molecular dynamics and metadynamics simulations using GROMACS; and quantum chemical calculations using Gaussian, Dalton, MOLCAS and Turbomole

i. numpy: Problems that require use of linear algebra are placed in numpy directory: some examples include finding internal coordinates from Cartesian coordinates and generating initial velocities for MD simulations. In future, scripts related to unitary transformations of orbitals and simple optimization problems will be included.

ii. Problems related to analyzing MD trajectoies, block averaging and error calculations are kept in pandas directory

iii. Codes for generating publication quality plots such as line plots, scatter plots, pie charts, histograms, contour plots and 3D plots
